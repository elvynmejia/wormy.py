This is a term project for CSC206 Pythong Programming SFSU Fall 2012.
The goal of this project is to learn Python programming. 
This project is based on Wormy, a game written in Python. 
You can see the originial source code at http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapter6.html 
You can also read a brief description of the game at 
https://github.com/elvynmejia/python_programs/blob/master/python_term_project/Elvyn%20Mejia.docx click on View Raw 
to download the docx document. 

In this project, I extended the behavior of the original Wormy and added documentation and new behaviors. For example,
in Modified_Wormy.py, I defined and added behavior to two new functions. In play_a_different_song(), a added a list of 
songs that will randomly play when you start a new game and during the game. In the function wormySound() I added a .wav
sound effect so that you can heard the worm "eat" the apple. I used the pygame library to acomplish all of this. 

Please note that I didn't create this game from scratch but instead used existing code, modified its contents,
added new documentatio and behaviors. Enjoy.
